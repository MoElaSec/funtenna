                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>During World War II, scientists from Bell Labs discovered the electromagnetic side channel
                        attack, recovering plain text from a Signal Corps cryptocenter. The US military developed
                        policies intended to prevent attacks of this class; there is evidence that the Soviet Union knew
                        of these attacks as early as 1951. The US government began to develop a standard called TEMPEST
                        in the late 1950s <a href="#cite-boak">[1]</a>. Van Eck discovered an attack (so-called "Van Eck
                        phreaking") which used an ordinary television set to recover information from a CRT
                        monitor <a href="#cite-van-eck">[2]</a>; declassified documents suggest that the NSA had been
                        aware of the EM risk from CRT displays for at least four years before Van Eck published his
                        results <a href="#cite-nsa">[3]</a>.</p>

                        <p>In a 1983 operation called Project GUNMAN, the NSA discovered bugs that had been planted in
                        typewriters in the US embassy in Moscow nearly 10 years prior. These bugs used RF to exfiltrate
                        data about the information typed to the Soviets <a href="#cite-maneki">[4]</a>.</p>

                        <p>In 2012, members of the Imperial College Robotics Society at Imperial College London used
                        Raspberry Pi hardware meant to generate clock signals on GPIO pins to transmit FM radio
                        <a href="#cite-pifm">[5]</a>.</p>

                        <p>The funtenna is a combination of all of these ideas: it uses electromagnetic radiation as a
                        data exfiltration medium (GUNMAN) on equipment that gives off EM radiation as a side effect
                        (TEMPEST/Van Eck) controlled in software (PiFM).</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>How it Works</h2>
                        <p>A funtenna must be able to generate a radio signal in software and modulate that signal in
                        order to encode data. Then, a receiver must be able to reverse the process in order to recover
                        the encoded data.</p>

                        <h3>Generating a Signal</h3>
                        <h4>GPIO</h4>
                        <p>This is the method that inspired the Funtenna. It involves hijacking GPIO (which includes
                        switches, lights, and other fun hardware). We used this for our BeagleBone proof-of-concept.
                        Most of the time, will have to be modulated by the CPU (which increases detection risk).</p>

                        <h4>UART</h4>
                        <p>UART hardware can take care of modulation itself, which reduces CPU load and allows for more
                        precise control over frequency.</p>

                        <h3>Modulating the Signal</h3>
                        <h4>On-Off Keying</h4>
                        <p>This is the simplest possible method of modulation. It sends a signal to represent a 1, or no
                        signal to represent a 0. Very easy to implement, but not the fastest or most reliable.<p>

                        <h4>Frequency-Shift Keying</h4>
                        <p>Send one frequency to represent a 1, and another for a 0 (this can be generalized to include
                        more symbols). It is a little trickier to implement, but can send data faster (and can
                        distinguish between not transmitting and transmitting a 0.</p>

                        <h3>Receiving the Signal</h3>
                        <h4>USRP</h4>
                        <p>We used a USRP2 (discontinued) tuned to the target frequency to receive the signal. The USRP
                        integrates well with GNU Radio.</p>

                        <h4>Antenna</h4>
                        <p>For the first proof-of-concept, we just used a long spool of wire. Eventually, we moved on to
                        improvised antennas (wire wrapped around wooden sticks) and finally a legitimate antenna (from
                        Pixel Technologies). Better antennas give better range.</p>

                        <h3>Demodulating the Signal</h3>
                        <h4>GNU Radio</h4>
                        <p>We encoded data using a Hamming(7,4) code with an extra parity bit and wrote GNU Radio blocks
                        to decode online. We also used built-in automatic gain control, a band pass filter, and other
                        useful signal-processing blocks.</p>

                        <h3>Reference Implementation</h3>

                        <p>This is the code for the reference implementation. The experimental setup involves</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a BeagleBone running Ångström Linux,</li>
                            <li>a USRP2,</li>
                            <li>a homemade antenna, and</li>
                            <li>GNU Radio.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>See the <a href="http://www.github.com/znewman01/ref_design">reference design repository on
                        GitHub</a> for instructions to reproduce and experimental details.</p>

                        <p>In this implementation, a BeagleBone bit-banging a GPIO pin transmitted text at a distance of
                        30 feet at 12.5 MHz.</p>
